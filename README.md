Extracted the data from Kaggle, Data containes purchase and demographic information. Performerd EDA, (Removed non informative columns, Chose Label Encoding vs One hot encoding) Normalized the data. We can give weightage to the columns we want. Computed Gap Statistics to get the best k. Verified the scores with Silhoulette, elbow and Davies-Bouldin index methods. Trained KMeans with k=6 Inspected the correlation matrix to understand the reasoning behind the clustering Inspected the more correlated columns to add meaning to the clusters by giving relavant names.
